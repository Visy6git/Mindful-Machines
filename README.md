# Mindful-Machines

**Mindful-Machines** is a Gen-AI tool designed to empower indie game developers by automatically creating personalized game styles based on player skills and preferences. Built with Python and Flask, our solution leverages the emerging [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E4%B8%8A%E4%B8%8B%E6%96%87%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE) – an open standard developed by Anthropic – to standardize interactions between large language models (LLMs) and external data sources.

## Overview

**Mindful-Machines** harnesses advanced generative AI to analyze gameplay performance and player behavior. By doing so, it generates a dynamic, personalized game style—adjusting art, mechanics, and narrative tone—to enhance the overall gaming experience. Our application uses Python and Flask for its backend, while integrating with LLMs via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to ensure standardized, context-aware data exchange with external resources.

## Problem Statement

Indie game developers often struggle with the manual, time-intensive process of tailoring game aesthetics and mechanics to suit individual player abilities. Generic templates can miss the nuances of player behavior, leading to experiences that feel either too generic or misaligned with player skills. The challenge is to provide a solution that automates this customization, reducing overhead while preserving creative flexibility.

---

## Who It Helps

**Mindful-Machines** is designed for:
- **Indie Game Developers:** Empowering small studios and solo developers to rapidly prototype and deploy personalized game styles.
- **Design Teams:** Streamlining the process of game style adaptation so designers can focus on high-level creative decisions.
- **Player Experience Researchers:** Facilitating data-driven insights into how personalized game experiences impact engagement and satisfaction.

---

## Our Approach

We address the challenge by:
1. **Leveraging Python and Flask:** Our robust backend is built with Python and Flask, ensuring a lightweight yet scalable web application.
2. **Utilizing the Model Context Protocol (MCP):** By adopting MCP, we create a standardized interface that lets our LLM seamlessly interact with external data sources and tools. This allows the system to access real-time context information to refine and tailor game styles.
3. **Dynamic Analysis & Generation:** Our system gathers gameplay metrics and user feedback in real time, feeding this information to an LLM that generates a personalized game style blueprint.
4. **Context Management with Flask:** We take advantage of Flask’s application and request contexts to manage resources (like database connections and configuration parameters) safely across concurrent requests.

---

## Technical Details

- **Backend Framework:** Python with Flask provides our web server and API endpoints.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** MCP standardizes how our LLM retrieves external context, ensuring our outputs are both accurate and relevant.
- **LLM Integration:** Our generative model uses context from MCP to produce dynamic game style recommendations.
- **Flask Contexts:** We utilize Flask’s application and request contexts to safely manage state, ensuring that resources like database sessions and configuration objects are isolated per request.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Flask (installed via pip)
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mindful-machines.git
   cd mindful-machines
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

''''bash
  Copy
  Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root with:

env
Copy
Edit
API_KEY=your_llm_api_key
MCP_ENDPOINT=https://mcp.example.com/api  # MCP server endpoint
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
Usage
Start the Flask server by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
flask run
The application will be available at http://localhost:5000. From there, you can upload gameplay metrics, view the personalized game style output, and interact with our MCP-powered backend.
